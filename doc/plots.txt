OVERVIEW

This package provides simple and fast utilities for creating
figures. Programs operate on data streams, succeed silently, and try
not to make many assumptions about formats or parameters.  The primary
design motivation was ease of use in unix scripting, which enables the
end user to 'pipeline' a series of visualizations.

CONTENTS

After installing the plots package (see install.txt for help), a set
of scripting utilities will be located under bin/.  Information about
running each program can be found by running the program with the
'--help' flag.  A brief overview of the plotting programs:

o hist:     Create a histogram.  User must specify the high and low
            bins.  This program is a wrapper for gsl-histogram.
o scatter:  Compares two variables via scatterplot.  The program takes
            a file stream input consisting of two tab-delimited
            columns of numeric values.
o series:   Plot a series of data.  Multiple columns of input will plot
            multiple series.
o spark:    A simplified version of 'series'.  Consider

	    for an in-depth explanation of the theory and purpose of sparklines.

EXAMPLES

Numerous examples are contained in the share/ directory of the
installation.  For single, 'ad-hoc' uses for the plotting programs,
consider the examples in single-instances.sh.  A more pipelined,
data-management emphasized style of plotting is demonstrated in
multi-instances.sh
